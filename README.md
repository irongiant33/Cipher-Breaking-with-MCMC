This project employs the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm
to accurately decrypt a cipher text file into its original
plain text version. The goal of this implementation of the
MH algorithm is to find the arbitrary cipher function
that encrypted the plain text into the cipher text in both nonadversarial
and adversarial scenarios. In a non-adversarial
scenario, this implementation of the MH algorithm decrypts
the plain text with 100% accuracy. In an adversarial scenario where the cipher changes at a random point during the message,
this implementation of the MH algorithm decrypts the plain
text with greater than 99% accuracy.
